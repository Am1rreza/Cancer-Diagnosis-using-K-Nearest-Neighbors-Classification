# Cancer Diagnosis using K-Nearest Neighbors Classification

This project is a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm to predict cancer diagnosis. The notebook utilizes popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The main goal of this project is to help beginners understand how to implement KNN classification algorithms in Python and apply them to real-world datasets, specifically focusing on healthcare applications such as cancer diagnosis.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter notebook, you'll need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Download the Cancer_Data.csv dataset and save it in the same directory as the notebook.

2. Open the Cancer_Diagnosis_KNN.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. Run each cell sequentially to follow along with the project.
